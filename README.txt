MLinhA - A Machine Learning Model for Activity Prediction Against inhA from Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

Overview:

This repository contains a machine learning model developed to predict pIC50 values for molecules based on their Mordred descriptors. The model utilizes the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm, a powerful tool for regression tasks, to provide accurate estimations of a compound's inhibitory concentration against a biological target.

Our model can be used through our FastAPI endpoints.
